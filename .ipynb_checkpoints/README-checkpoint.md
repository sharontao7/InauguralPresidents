## LING413 Assignment 2: Corpus Analysis of Presidential Inaugural Speeches

The purpose of this assignment is to present a detailed corpus analysis of US Presidential Inaugural Addresses. It aims at examining the vocabulary and language of 40 presidents' first inaugural speeches to extract information about various periods American history and society. By doing such data analysis, one can observe changes in the political, economic, and social climate in the United States.

To achieve a detailed corpus search and quantitative analysis, I mainly used the NLTK, spaCy, and pysyllables libraries for language processing, and matplotlib for the visuals. 

This code was written in Python3 so you should make sure this is installed. You should be able to run this notebook step-by-step(one cell at a time) using *shift+enter*. Another way is to click on *Cell->Run All* in the menu to execute the entire notebook.
